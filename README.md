# PiCar 

### PiCar is now depreceated PiCar2 is the more up to date version ###

So I put a raspbery pi in my car, this is initially starting out as a media player.
Requires directory Media and subdirectories Images, Music, and Videos.
I realize I probably should have make a repo earlier but I didn't so, fight me.

## Version 0.1 ##
Added actual functionality to the Update.py, now simply run this file to get the most up to date version of the code
